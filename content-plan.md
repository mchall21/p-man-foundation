# P-Man Foundation — Content-First Site Plan (Markdown)

## Global Principles

### Brand Voice

* Clear, human, spare.
* Hopeful, not saccharine. “One more good day” is the north star.
* Evidence-led: pair stories with numbers.

### Messaging Pillars

* **One more good day** — the core idea and outcome.
* **Microgrants → immediate, local impact.**
* **100% of donations fund grants** — the ride funds itself via tickets.

### Navigation & CTAs

* Primary CTAs (always visible): **Donate**, **Apply**.
* Secondary: **Pedal for P-Man**, **Impact**.

### Design System (High Level)

* Look/feel: clean, high-contrast, generous whitespace, large type.
* Imagery: candid, daylight, warm; bikes, groups in motion; real photos.
* Icons: simple line icons; avoid stigma visuals.
* Accessibility: 4.5:1 contrast; 16px+ body; meaningful alt text; clear focus states.
